# Zen Task â€“ Coding Exercise

Welcome, and thanks for taking the time to code with us!  
The goal is to **extend** a tiny task-timer app, not to build one from scratch.  
We care about clean reasoning, incremental commits, and working code more than pixel-perfect UI.

## ðŸ“‹  Project Overview

Zen Task is a focus tool: each task has a single **allocated time** and a **timer** you can start/stop.  
The starter project already shows three sample tasks and a working Start/Stop button that logs to the console.

**Tech already in place**
