# Zen Task â€“ Coding Exercise

Welcome, and thanks for pairing with us! The goal is to **extend** a tiny task-timer app, not build one from scratch. We care about clear reasoning, incremental commits, and working code more than pixel-perfect UI.

## ðŸ“‹  Project Overview
Zen Task lets you focus on a single task at a time. Each task has:
- an **allocated time** in minutes
- a **timer** you can start/stop

The starter app shows three sample tasks and a Start/Stop button that logs to the console.

### Tech already in place
